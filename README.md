# Sample Data Structures

As I teach data structure, I find that I am constantly looking for good examples.
Simple implementations that use standard conventions and keep to a simple interface.
Our goal is to create basic data structures using simple interfaces with alternate implementations.
The purpose is to use these as teaching aids.
Any homework assignments can use these as starting points to build extra or more complicated solutions.
